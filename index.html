Hi! My name is Simon Frischknecht and I'm a Master student focusing on Data Science at the University of Zurich (UZH). Right now I am writing my master thesis analyzing speech data by using unsupervised learning. <br />
Until recently, I was working as a part-time data analyst at the University Hospital Zurich. <br />
I'm very interested in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_inference" target="blank">statistical methods</a> 
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning" target="blank">machine learning</a> algorithms for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning" target="blank">supervised</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning" target="blank">unsupervised</a> learning.
